The next day, the family walks deep into the woods and Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles. 
Their father lights a fire for them in the woods, and goes to gather more wood. After a while, the kids realize the father isn't coming back. Gretel cries, but Hansel tells her all will be fine. After nightfall, they follow his shiny pebbles back to the house, arriving by morning. 
Their father is overjoyed, and takes them back in as he was very upset about leaving them in the first place.
